"""
Code Analysis:
- The main goal of the function is to delete products from a customer's cart based on the quantity specified in the request data.
- It is an API view function that accepts a DELETE request and requires the user to be authenticated.
- It retrieves the user object from the request and finds the corresponding customer object from the Customer table.
- It gets the list of products to be deleted from the request data.
- It retrieves all existing cart items for the customer.
- It deletes cart items if there are no products left in them.
- It loops through the list of products to be deleted and tries to find an existing cart item with the given product and customer.
- If an existing cart item is found, it decreases its quantity based on the quantity specified in the request data. If the quantity becomes zero, the cart item is deleted.
- It returns a message indicating the success of the operation and the updated cart items for the customer in the response.
- The function uses the IsAuthenticated permission class to ensure that only authenticated users can access it.
- It uses the get_object_or_404 function to retrieve objects from the database and raise a 404 error if they do not exist.
- It uses the CartSerializer to serialize the updated cart items before sending them in the response.

Test Plan:
- test_authenticated_user_deletes_valid_products(): tests that an authenticated user can delete valid products from their cart. Tags: [happy path]
- test_user_not_authenticated(): tests that a user who is not authenticated cannot delete products from their cart. Tags: [edge case]
- test_no_products_specified(): tests that the function returns a message indicating that no items were deleted if the list of products to be deleted is empty. Tags: [edge case]
- test_cart_item_deleted_by_another_user(): tests that the function handles cases where the cart item is deleted by another user or process while the function is running. Tags: [general behavior]
- test_product_deleted_by_another_user(): tests that the function handles cases where the product is deleted by another user or process while the function is running. Tags: [general behavior]
- test_invalid_product_ids_or_quantities(): tests that the function handles cases where the user sends a DELETE request with invalid product IDs or quantities. Tags: [edge case]
- test_products_not_in_cart(): tests that the function handles cases where the user sends a DELETE request with products that are not in their cart. Tags: [edge case]
- test_customer_object_not_found(): tests that the function returns a 404 error if the customer object cannot be found. Tags: [edge case]
- test_user_object_not_found(): tests that the function returns a 404 error if the user object cannot be found. Tags: [edge case]
- test_quantity_greater_than_cart_item(): tests that the function returns a message indicating that no items were deleted if the specified quantity is greater than the quantity in the cart item. Tags: [edge case]
